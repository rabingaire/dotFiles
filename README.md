# dotFiles
dotFiles from my machine :) 

### How to use this dot file ?

1. Clone this repo on Home directory
2. Run the following commands on terminal
```
cd ./dotFile/
chmod +x run.sh
./run.sh
```
3. NOTE: No need to install vim, zsh and tmux this script automatically does that :) 
4. Now Figure out yourself how to use the files under this repo LOL :)
